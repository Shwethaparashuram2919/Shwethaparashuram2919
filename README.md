Question 2
How many ways are there to arrange the letters in the word ALGORITHMS? Note, the letter arrangement does not have to spell a word in the dictionary, but the new word must contain all the letters and each letter can be used only once. 

Hint: Start with shorter words (e.g ALG or ALGO) and see if a pattern emerges with the number of possible arrangements.
